**Overview**<br>
Youtube Data Analysis<br>
Analysis of structured data has seen tremendous success in the past. However,
analysis of large scale unstructured data in the form of video format remains a
challenging area. YouTube, a Google company, has over a billion users and generates
billions of views. Since YouTube data is getting created in a very huge amount and with
an equally great speed, there is a huge demand to store, process and carefully study this
large amount of data to make it usable.<br><br>


**Objective**<br>
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate by using Bigdata concepts,
how data generated from YouTube can be mined and utilized to make targeted, real time
and informed decisions.<br>
**Technolgies and tools used for this project are:**<br>
1.Hadoop<br>
2.Hive<br>
3.Spark-scala<br>
4.Mysql<br>
5.Power Bi<br>
