Amazon Review Analysis<br>
Everyday we come across various products in our lives, on the digital medium we swipe across hundreds of product choices under one category.<br>
It will be tedious for the customer to make selection.<br>
Here comes 'reviews' where customers who have already got that product leave a rating after using them and brief their experience by giving reviews.<br>
As we know ratings can be easily sorted and judged whether a product is good or bad.<br>
But when it comes to sentence reviews we need to read through every line to make sure the review conveys a positive or negative sense.<br>
